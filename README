Benchmark suite for WFVOpenCL.
==============================

1. Requirements
---------------

* WFVOpenCL (https://github.com/karrenberg/wfvopencl)
* SCons (http://www.scons.org)

2. Building
--------

First you need to set the paths WFV_INSTALL DIR and WFVOPENCL_INSTALL_DIR to
their appropriate locations.

$ export WFV_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/whole-function-vectorization
$ export WFVOPENCL_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/wfvopencl

To build the benchmarks, simply run

$ scons

The binaries can then be found in the directory build/bin. For example, to run
the NBody test, execute

$ build/bin/NBodySimple

This should display some nice yellow dots flying through space.

3. Measuring
------------

TODO: How do I use the benchmarks to compare this driver to others?
